Thanks for checking out my algorithm visualizer!  
This program visualizes two major categories of algorithms: Pathfinding algorithms and Sorting algorithms.  
  
## Pathfinding Algorithms
To play around with the algorithm, you can build and destroy walls, move around the start and target nodes, and change the algorithm speed.  
### Included:
- Djikstra's
- A*
- BFS
- DFS
  
## Sorting Algorithms
To play around with the algorithms, you can change the size of the array, and you can try randomized or nearly sorted data.  
### Included:
- Selection Sort
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Quick Sort
- Heap Sort
- Shell Sort
